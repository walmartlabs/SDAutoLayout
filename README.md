# SDAutoLayout

A collection of categories to enable writing more descriptive auto layout code. Currently this is simply a copy of [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout) with a naming convention more suited to the collection of code on our organization. In the future we expect to extend it as needed.

## Usage

For now, check out the API details at [PureLayout](https://github.com/smileyborg/PureLayout) while using the updated naming convention as seen in the [headers](SDAutoLayout).

### Example Project

The following projects use this API:

- [SDActivityHUD](https://github.com/setdirection/SDActivityHUD)
